§XLVIIL One of the works contem·
plated by Sir Simon D’Ewes was, “ The
“ antiquity of the Municipal or Com-
“ mon law of the Realm before the Nor-
“ man Conquest‚ out of records sor the
“ greatest part, or other unvulgar mate·
“ rials;”—to this be intended to add a
second part out of the “ Itinerant and Plea
“ Rons, chiefly remaining in the Treasury
“ at Westminster,”— or the muniments of
which this present publication is composed.
—“These,”— he continues,—“ 1 have pro-
“ posed to m yself to labour in‚besides divers
“ other smaller works, as well theologica}
“ as moral, like him that shoots at the Suu,
“ not in hopes to reach it, but to shoot as
“ high as possibly his strength, art, or skill
“ will permit. So, though Ι know it is
·‘ impossible to finisb all these during my
“ short 8ηά uncertain life, having already
“ entred into the thirtieth year of my age,
“ 8ηά having many unavoidable imploy-
“ ments 8ηά cares of an estate 8ηά family,
“ yet if I ean finish a little in each kind, it
“ may hereaster stir up some able judg-
“ ments to add an end to the whole, in
“the same way and search 1 shall have
“ waded in before them. ln the mean
“ time 1 shall always pray, as 1 do sin·
