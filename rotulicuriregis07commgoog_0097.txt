Mam, arrived at Beaufort in Anjou on
Easter Day‚ and there he celebrated the
Paschal festival. Thence he advanced to
Rouen‚ where he was received without op-

suprame- Easter‚ being the feast of St. Mark the
Evangelist, he was solemnly inaugurated
in the Metropolitan Church of Rouen:
and girt with the sword of the Duchy by
the hands of Archbishop Walter, who also
placed upon his head the golden coronal.

Eve‚ perhaps an echo of the vague
and ominous rumours floating in Nor-
