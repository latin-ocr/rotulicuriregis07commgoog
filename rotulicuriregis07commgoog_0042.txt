the letters of the Prelates, which at once
declared the misconduct of the MonkS, and
entreated the Pope to sanction the re-
organization of the Cathedral‚ by the intro-
duction of a secular Chapter. During six
monthS, the Pope suspended the sentence,
to the intent that the Monks might, if they
pleased, appear and shew cause against it.
Their poverty incapacitated them from
making their defence, and, as it is said, a
sentence was pronounced, by which they

were expelled ; but it is by no means cer-
tain that they were legally abolished or sup-

pressed, as pleaded by the CanonS. The
hood and the amice replaced frock and
cowl. The Canons were installed: and,
the better to efface all recollection of the
former inmates‚ Bishop Hugh pulled down
the conventual buildings, and rebuilt them
upon a new plan, paying the expences with
the moveable goods of the late community.

It appears, however, from the pleadings
on the roll, that the Monks kept together as
a body, notwithstanding their expulsion3
nor was any legal objection taken by the
Court against their corporate existence.
Similar examples may be found in modern
timeS‚ the Monks of La Trappe and the
Nuns of Syon having, though despoiled of
their possessionS, equally withstood the
Revolution of France, and the Reformation
