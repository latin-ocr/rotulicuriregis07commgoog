INTRODUCTION. xcvii

enable the Sovereign to exercise his lawful
authority, for this position is clearly to be
collected from narratives in the City Year
Book: still the Crown descended by here-
ditary right to the eldest son: And by the
proclamation alone, before the coronation,
the Lord of England acquired the title of
King.

This, certainly was a doctrine established
subsequently -to John's accession. The
different brancbes of the government were
making a symmetrical advance. Parliament
was obtaining more influence: and at the
same time, the Throne was acquiring
greater stability.

But what was intended by the style
of “ Dominus Angliae 2>”—This title appears
to indicate the right to the superiority
over the soil, when distinguished from the
chieftainship of the people³ The King
might be admitted as Dominus Anglioe
before he was acknowledged as Rex Anglo-
rum.- and this distinction was consistently
maintained. John was Lord of Ireland‚
but he did not claim to be King of the
Irish. Edward wrote himself Lord of
Scodand, and acknowledged Balliol to be
King of the ScotS.
