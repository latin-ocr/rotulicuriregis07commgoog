nity whilst the kingdom should be ‘⁶ without
a King'’— dum Regnum esset sine Rege.—
But this ——continues the writer of the Year
Book of London, probably the Town Clerk,
— was an erroneous opinion, for immedi-
ately upon the King’s death the Kingdom
devolved upon Dominus Edward his son .--
And when — continues this writer—all the
people should have done sealty to him, then
it was certain that all who, being under his
dominion, perpetrate any act against the
peace, should be as grievously punisbed as
under the dominion of his living father.
And the lesser Commons were prevented
from perpetrating this iniquity, because im-
1⁷Nov.1272. mediately upon King Henry’s death, “ on
the Morrow of Saint Edmund the Arch-
bishop,'' the Earl of Gloucester‚ the Arch-
bishop of York, and many other Nobles of
the realm ofEngland then present, came into
the City and caused peace to be proclaimed
towards all, both Jews and Christiana.
From this proceeding, three important
facts may be collected respecting the theory
and practice of the Constitution in relation
to regal succession, as prevailing when
Henry 111. closed his reign: I.—The people
of London, more thoroughly an Anglo·
Saxon community than any other then sub-
sisting, and probably never merged in any ¹ .
