NOTES. cxiii

Pope was startled and scared‚ and aster expressing his surprize
to the Cardinals in somewhat unseemly language, he turned to
the Monk‚ and said, ‘⁶ Brother, by St. Peter you shall not wait
for my death, your petition is granted ;'' and before Pope Inno-
cent again tasted food, he issued the Bull by which Archbishop
Hubert was authorized to restore the Monastery.

Now as this statement is wholly inconsistent with the Bull,
which is preserved textually and entire, we must either admit
that the document is a forgery - and, at this period, the practice

of fabricating spurious Bulls prevailed exceedingly — or that

Matthew Paris, the Monk of St. Albans, was singularly
deceived.

It is probable that Hubert was the ward of Glanville. He thus
expresses himself on the Foundation Charter of West Dereham.—-
Omnibus Sanctoe Matris Ecclesioe filiis, praesentibus et futuris,
Hubertus Dei gratia, Eboracensis ecclesiae DecanuS, aeternam in
Domino salutem. Sapientis est hiis, quae salute animae proficiunt,
dum potest, intendere et transitoriis aeterna commutare. Quod
quidem intelligentes . . . . . quoddam coenobium Praemonstratensis
Ordinis in feudo nostr0‚ apud Derham fundavimus, pro salute
animae meoe, et patris et matris meoe, et Domini Ranulplzi de
Glanvilld et Bertae uxoris ejus qui nos nutrierunt. (Monasticon,
vol. vi. 899.) —Geoffry Fitz Peter is one os the attesting wit-
nesses to the Charter.

Diceto, 652. -- The good Bishop was thus licensed by three
consecutive Metropolitans‚ the Venerable Ansehn‚ Ralph, and
william de Corboyl. It therefore appears that he did not con-
sider that the sanction given by the Archbishop for the time
being, bound his successors.
