The membranes of the Rolls are stitched or fastened together
at the top of each skin. This appears to have been the custom
of the Exchequer in all its bmches, from the earliest periods·
It is thus that the Pipe Rolls are made up, and all the Judicial'
Rolls. The same custom prevailed in the Exchequer of Nor-
mandy. But in the charmel-y, the rolls were and still are made

up by attaching the membranes end to end. The Lithographs

the rolla and of other coeval documents.

others in the accusation, Fratrem suum quoque carnalem, duos

reos in conventiculis suis, ad mortem usque persequebatur.
