‘⁶ I am in want of mon‘ey‚’'—continued Earl
John‚—·“ a word to the wise is enough.''
And having thus spoken, he departed‚
leaving them to consider this pithy moni-
tion. Anxions to prevent the return of
their hated enemy, they agreed to buy John
off, by lending him five hundred pounds
from the King’s treasury. The Earl forth-

addressed to him in the name of the Queen‚
the Clergy‚ and the people‚ insisting upon
his immediate departure from the Realm.
