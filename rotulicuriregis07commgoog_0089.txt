concerning the collegiate chapel founded
at Lambeth‚ and by means of which, a pre-
benda} Chapter would have obtained the
rights hitherto vested in the Monks of the

Cathedral. It was contrary to all ecclesi-
astical discipline, —they complained to the
Pope,—that Hubert Archbishop of Canter-
bury should act as the King’s Justiciar,
sitting as a judge upon criminals con-
demned to capital punishment, and be ⁰
so entirely wrapped up and engrossed in
secular affairS, that all his ecclesiastica!
duties were neglected and cast aside. --
They concluded their charges against the
Archbishop by declaring to the Pope, how,
contrary to all the privileges and immuni·

. ties of Holy Church, he had violated the

Sanctum-y of St. Mary le Bow, from whence
William with the Long Beard was forcibly
taken, condemned to death, and hanged
on the tree.

The Pope received the accusation,and ad-
mitted its relevancy. Addressing Richard,
he exhorted him, as he tendered his soul's
health, to remove the Archbishop from the
Justiciarship: and furthermore, wholly to
abstain thenceforth from employing any
Prelate in secular affairs. A concurrent
mandate was addressed to all the Prelates,
strictly prohibiting them from meddling
with employments so uncongenial to their
