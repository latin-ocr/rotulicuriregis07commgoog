The Bull granted by Pope Celestine sor the restoration of
the Monk3, is transcribed both by Hoveden and in the annals of
Burton, and it speaks of Hugh Nonant as being then alive. The
narrative of Matthew Paris, which is very circumstantial, ascribes
the restoration of the Convent to Innocent 111. his successor.
Some few of the Monks‚ as he sayS, had repaired to Rome, for
the purpose of inducing the Pope to restore the Monastery.
There they lingered: some, wearied out by disappointment and

only one remained‚ Brother Thomas, who, from extreme want, ⁸
was often forced to beg his bread. About this time, , Hugh de
Nonant, being on his way to Rome, suddenly sickened when in
Normandy. Conscious that his death was nigh, he sent far and

the Monks of Coventry, warring against them with mortal hatred;
and, earnestly entreating from the Abbot of Bec-Herlouin, that
he might be clothed with the habit of that order which he had
persecuted, he died.

Thomas, and when Pope Innocent, who had then lately been
enthroned‚ was sitting in full consistory‚ he came before the
Pontiff, and preferred his prayer for the restoration of the Monas-
tery. ‘⁶ Know ye not, Brother,”— replied the Pope, with great
wrath‚ —“ that my predecessore, Clement and Celestine, ost and
ost rejected the same petition‚ aye, and 1 saw and heard them.

‘⁶ Holy Father,”— rejoined the Monk, —“ 1 wait not in vain.
My petitionis just and right3 and Ι wait for your death, even as
Ι waited for the deaths of your predecessore. One may succeed
you, who will effectuffly grant my prayerss’f— By this address the
