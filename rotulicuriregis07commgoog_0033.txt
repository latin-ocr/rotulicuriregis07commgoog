in which he proposed to resist a siege.-
“ Come out and abide the laW‚'’—was the
summons received by Fitz Osbert‚ and
which he knew he could not dare to obey.
The Archbishop, wholly disregarding
the immunities of his peculiar Sanctuaryj
gave orden, to the great astonishment and
marvel of the surrounding crowd, that Fitz
Osbert should be expelled by main force.
And when it was ascertained that the victim
had fied to the tower of the church, the
Archbishop directed that the structure
should be set on fire. The fierce flames
compelled Fitz Osbert to abandon his
stronghold: he descended and attempted
to escape. As he was rushing out, he was
stabbed by the son of the citizen whom he
had slain‚ secured‚ bound with fetters and
manacles, and carried to the Tower of Lon·
don. The “ Majores '' of the city and
the King’s officers, all joined in urging the
Justiciar to “inflict a condign punishment
upon the offender. Fitz Osbert‚ by ad-
vice of the ‘⁶ Proceres ’' assembled at the
Tower, was condemned to die. The sen-
tence was executed with the usual barbarity.
Stripped naked, and tied by a rope to the
horse’s tail, William was dragged over the
rough and flinty roads to Tyburn‚ where his
lacerated and almost lifeless carcass was

hung in chains on the fatal elm.
