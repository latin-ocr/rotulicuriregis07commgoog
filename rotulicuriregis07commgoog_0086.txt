is generally designated either as ‘⁶ Dominus
Archiepiscopus '' or “ Dominus Cant’.”
From the similarity between the letters t ¹
and c in the record, the word “ Cant' '' haS,
in the extracts heretofore made from these
Rolls, been transcribed as “ Canc' ”3 so that,
supposing any legal hypothesis had been
grounded upon the printed text, the en-
quirer would have inevitably transferred
the J usticiar's authority to the Chan-
cellor.

The policy of the reign of Coeur de Lion
is of no import, except to the historian or
the antiquary. But it may be here remarked,
that an error, exactly of the same descrip-
tion, probably contributed to establish the
authority of arrest and detention exercised
by the members of the Privy Council. In a
case arising out of their supposed jurisdic-
tion, a document was produced, which, any
person moderately acquainted with recordS,
would, I think, have expounded as eviden-
cing a committal “ per dnos de Concili0.”
The Court admitted the reading, ‘⁶ per duos
‘⁶ de Consilio;'' and the ambiguous form of
a letter, vested in any two individual mem-
bers, whose signatures could be obtained,
the power which, according to the antient
constitution, belonged to the Lords of the

Council sitting in their corporale capacity,
and as a tribunal.
