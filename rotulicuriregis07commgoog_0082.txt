we find that Sarah de Bonneville, wounded
and robbed by tbe armed offenders, wh0,
instigated by her daughter-in-law Con-
stantia, had attacked her in her dwelling,
first preferred her appeal before the Queen
and the Archbishop of Rouen. A short
incidental notice of her authority appears
on another appeal. In a curious chiro-
grapb or agreement, made in the Curia
Regis in the Exchequer, the Archbishop, App. 11.
described as J usticiar of England, appears
sitting below John Earl of Moreton and
above the Treasurer and BaronS. John
took his place in court as Governor of the
Kingdom: and which station he probably
retained until his open rupture with Richard‚
when, having quitted England, he became
the sworn liegeman of the French King.

upon Hubert, Archbishop of Canterbury.
Hubert Walter, lately advanced from the
see of Salisbury to the archiepiscopal dig-
nity, had been educated in the house and
under the guardianship of Ralph de Glan- (Nou F.)

ville. Hubert was equally indebted to the
