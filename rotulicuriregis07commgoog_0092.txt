Ralph de DicetO, a most trusty and ac-
curate testimony, was not acquainted with
the history of the treasure‚ and commemo-
rates Peter Bas-il -— and not Bertram de
Gurdun—as the soldier by whose arrow
Richard was stricken. And the chronicle of
Dunstaple, the Annals ofMargan, Matthew
Paris (or rather Roger wendover), and
Walsingham‚ relating the story of the trea-
sure, all designate the same Peter Basil as
the¹ youth by whom the quarrell was dis-
charged.

The manuscript chronic-le of Winchester
agrees with the last preceding authorities
in naming Peter Basil as the man, but
differs from them by ascribing to this indi-
vidual the unhappy fate of Bertram de Gur-
dzm, and yet with a variation. Mareadeus
surrendered the prisoner to Richard’s sister
J oan, Countess of St.Giles‚ and she, and,
not MarcadeuS, plucked out his eyeS, and
caused him to suffer other horrible mutila!
tions and tortureS, under which he expired.

The anonymous continuator of Geoffiy,
the Prior of VigeoiS, a Limoisin Monastery‚
places two knights, Peter Bru (perhaps
Brun) and Peter Basil, in the tower from
whence the missile proceeded: and adds,
that as it was reported, —a report which
he repeats without positively adopting it,—
PeterBasil was the marksman.
