nates to reinstate the Legate in his former
station of J usticiar. Arnon gst other reasons,
they urged that it would much displease
the King, to know how Longchamp had
been thus displaced from the government
of the Kingdom without his command.
A strange assertion this, in the face of the
letters patent by which John and his par·-
tizans had effected Longchamp’s expulsion‚
but entirely conformable to Longchamp's
declarations: and confirmed, indeed, by
what is stated, that Richard's determination
to return to England was accelerated by
the intelligence of Longehamp’s removal.
Taken any way, such an argument is a
strong exemplification of the prevailing
want of truth and principle.

Of John’s exertions on behalf of Long-
champ, one example is narrated with
amusing particularity. A Council or, as
we should call it, a Parliament, being as-
sembled at London, the messenger of
Longchamp, Legate and Chaucellor‚ sud-
denly entered, announcing the arrival
of his master at Dover. Alarmed at such
intelligence‚ they forthwith send to Earl
John, who is at Wallingford. Another
Council is held. In this, John informs
them that Longchamp defies them all,
provided he can obtain his, John's, pro·-
tection, for which he offers seven hun-

dred pounds, to be paid within a week.
